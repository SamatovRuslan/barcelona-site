# Current tasks

## Add style

- Each match should be in the separate row 
- Style of text should be: 
```md
<home-team> <score> <away-team>
       <date and time>
<home scorers>      <away scorers>  
            <stadium>
            <referee>

For example:
Benfica 3 - 0 Barcelona
      01:00 29.09.2021
Darwin, 12
Felix, 32
Darwin, 55
        Benfica Dragao Stadium
        Daniel Orsato
```

- Just try to make the site look professional
